PHP Patterns
============

A PHP 5.4+ pattern collection that covers design patterns, anti-patterns, closure patterns, refactoring patterns.

The Concepts
------------

* **Minimal and Conceptual** (useful as a pattern catalog)
* **Practical and Modern** (following [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/2/) as possible etc.)
* **PHP-specific** (with built-in features and SPL etc.)
* **Interface-oriented** (but as simple as possible)
* **Testable** (including test cases as examples [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/whizark/php-patterns.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/whizark/php-patterns) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/whizark/php-patterns/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/whizark/php-patterns))

(Since focusing on the core concept of each pattern, some patterns might not be the same as the originals.)
